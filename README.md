`he/him`

I'm a full-stack developer and aspiring creator of cool stuff. Building things is my way of turning the skills I've learned at work and school into fun projects of my own - as well as exploring new technologies along the way.

Right now, I'm focused on bringing applications to life from soup to nuts, and exploring how I can use AI to streamline that process - without slipping into the realm of "vibe coding." I'm also getting into homelabbing, with the goal of self-hosting my own projects on my personal server.
